- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sriram Krishnamoorthy
I am a graduate Mechanical Engineering student at Clemson University, with expertise in robotics and optimal control. My current project involves data-driven control for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains. This involves trajectory optimization using a global planner and optimal control using a model predictive control. Besides this, I have designed adaptive control algorithms for collaborative manipulation using multiagent systems for drones and ground robots.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
  - Data-driven control
  - Motion Planning
  - Optimal Control
  - Model Predictive Control
  - Deep learning
  - Reinforcement learning


- Check out my recent projects 
  - I designed a linear time-varying [model predictive controller](https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/Quad_ConvexMPC) for quadruped locomotion 
  - I worked on a density-based [motion planner](https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/Density-Feedback-Control/tree/robotic_arm) for robotic systems
  - I developed a [Koopman Autoencoder](https://github.com/sriram-2502/Deep_Koopman_AutoEncoder) for learning-based control complex nonlinear systems such as quadruped robots

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about traversability mapping using LIDARs for offroad navigation
