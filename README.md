- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sriram-2502
I am a graduate Mechanical Engineering student at Clemson University, with expertise in robotics and optimal control. My current project involves data-driven control for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains. This involves trajectory optimization using a global planner and optimal control using a model predictive control. Besides this, I have designed adaptive control algorithms for collaborative manipulation using multiagent systems for drones and ground robots.
