- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sriram Krishnamoorthy
I am a graduate Mechanical Engineering student at Clemson University, with expertise in robotics and optimal control. My current project involves data-driven control for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrains. This involves trajectory optimization using a global planner and optimal control using a model predictive control. Besides this, I have designed adaptive control algorithms for collaborative manipulation using multiagent systems for drones and ground robots.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
  - Deep learning
  - Data-driven control
  - Motion Planning
  - Optimal Control
  - Model Predictive Control
  - Reinforcement learning

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dual mode MPC and MPPI for quadruped locomotion with safety guarantees
- Check out my recent project where I designed a [LTV MPC for quadruped locomotion](https://github.com/AndrewZheng-1011/Quad_ConvexMPC)
- I love developing [learning-based control](https://github.com/sriram-2502/Deep_Koopman_AutoEncoder) for complex nonlinear systems such as quadruped robots
